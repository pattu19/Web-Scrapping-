# Web-Scrapping-
This project is a web scraper built using Scrapy with Splash to extract GSTIN, phone numbers, emails, and other relevant details from the HPRERA website. The scraper efficiently handles JavaScript-rendered content to gather the required data. It leverages Scrapy for web crawling, Splash as a headless browser for rendering JavaScript, and Asyncio for managing asynchronous tasks. To get started, clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and run Splash using Docker. You can then configure and run the spider to scrape the data and save it in JSON format. This project is structured with dedicated directories for spiders, middlewares, and settings, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. Contributions to enhance the scraper are welcome.
